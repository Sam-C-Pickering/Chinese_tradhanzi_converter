Goal 
----------------
To create and application to aid with my and other users learning experience primarily for Mandarin.
I wanted to create an application that can convert hanzi between traditional and simplified with notation support for pinyin and zhuyin with the most common reading for each hanzi.
I may add additional education material for teaching zhuyin & pinyin using avaliable anki decks as reference to improve exposure of notation types.
